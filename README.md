This project was created using React and Node.js. This application allows users to sign in/ log in, and from there, they are able to see different articles, and like or comment on them. Curently, the articles are not fully fleshed out with information on myself as the primary goal of this project so far was to just practice developing a fullstack application, although I will spend some time in the future to tailor those articles to myself, and add more, detailing my work on future projects. The project uses MongoDB for the database using AWS.
